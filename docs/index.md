## Concepts

The [purpose](/concepts/testing-purpose.md) of testing is to measure and maximise quality delivered, while minimising risk to an acceptable level. Testing [is not](/concepts/what-testing-is-not.md) straightforward. Testing [is](/concepts/what-testing-is.md) investigation, exploration, empathy, communication, and [it's not](/concepts/what-testing-is-not.md) limited to checking or automation.

As a tester, it will be your [responsibility](/concepts/tester-responsibilities.md) to be a guiding light, an inspector, a scout, a thinker, a bug detector, a (user) friend, a teammate andâ€¦ a learner â€” and that I know you are, since you're reading this :)

Stakeholders use or are affected by the product you are testing. You will clarify and detail their expectations into [requirements](/concepts/requirements.md). By advocating for [testability](/concepts/testability.md), you make testing less painful and more valuable for everyone involved.

## Toolbox

It all starts by describing how your team will test and report any discoveries. This is your [test strategy](/toolbox/test-strategy.md).

The testing community (and your experience) will show you which [tools and technologies](/toolbox/tester-tools.md) improve your testing. As a quality advocate, you should recommend to your team tools and [development methodologies](/toolbox/dev-methodologies.md) that increase your product's testability.

There are many techniques you can use to perform your role: a [charter](/toolbox/charters.md) summarises your testing goals and guides your exploration;  [oracles](/toolbox/oracles.md) are sources of knowledge that improve your testing; [heuristics](/toolbox/heuristics.md) can be used to pick what to test next or to make a decision when you don't have an oracle.

During your testing, you will discover new information. [Taking notes](/toolbox/note-taking.md) will structure your thinking, expand your memory and make it easier to share that information across the team. And [mnemonics](/toolbox/mnemonics.md) will reduce the effort of retrieving that information from your memory.

## Test types

Talking about different test types is difficult. It is important that you and your team speak the same testing language. There's so many different [types of tests](/types/test-types.md). The most popular are unit, integration, end-to-end and regression tests, but there are many more.

You can group those and many more tests into [functional vs non-functional testing](/types/test-types?id=functional-testing) or [black box vs white box testing](/types/test-types?id=black-box-testing). Not to mention different approaches to testing, like [exploratory](/types/test-types?id=ðŸ§­-exploratory-testing) or [automation](/types/test-types?id=ðŸ¤–-automation-in-testing). And did you know about advanced approaches like [chaos](/types/test-types?id=ðŸ’¥-chaos-testing) and [mutation](/types/test-types?id=ðŸ§¬-mutation-testing) testing?

And once you decide what types of tests you want to have, you need to think how many is good enough. The [testing pyramid](/types/test-pyramid.md) is an heuristic to help you find the balance that is right for your context.
